\section intro_sec Introduction

This project provides essential Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) algorithms and software. Software includes simple GNSS applications and a GNSS post processing software package.

The 'BSD-style' license (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_license) allows non-restrictive use for commercial and open source development.

\section goals_sec General Goals

- Facilitate many users by programming well and simply. 
- Facilitate growth of the code. 
- Allow users to get started easily and quickly. 
- This library intends to provide simple but robust and efficient functions for solving GNSS problems.
- Facilitate this library becoming part of other open source applications.

\subsection pg_sec Programming Goals

- Program from the ground up using 'c' for simple applications and 'c++' for more complicated applications. The following figure illustrates this principle.
- Minimize dependancies - allows lots of simple applications from a small part of the core code base.
- All code must be well commented. Comments for variables include units. Comments for algorithms include academic references.
- All core code algorithms require a corresponding unit test.
- Avoid complicated programming concepts. Keep it Simple S.....
- Include an example code snippet in the comment block whenever possible.

\section general_features_sec General Features
- Non-restrictive license that allows inclusion in proprietary commercial software (BSD-style license).
- Algorithms are properly referenced.
- Thorough documentation. Always refer to the .h files.
- Units provided for each parameter in the documenation.

\section postprocessing_sec GNSS Post Processing
- Easy to interpret and configure the option file. \html <a href="example_options.txt">click here for an example.</a>
- Stand alone and differential modes.
- Least squares.
- Extended Kalman filtering.
- Estimates position, velocity, ambiguities, receiver clock offset and drift.
- Utilize pseudorange, Doppler, and accumulated Doppler range (ADR, also called carrier phase) measurements.
- Data containers: Receiver objects have an array of channel objects.
- Data containers utilize a simple C++ style with minimal encapsulation.
- Uses the \html <a href="http://www.zenautics.com/matrixdoc/index.html">Zenautics Matrix/Vector class library</a>.
